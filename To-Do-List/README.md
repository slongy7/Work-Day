Work Day Simulator

This project had me produce a Work Day Simulator.  The idea is to use Module.js to have the time at the top in the Jumbotron stay up to date with each day.  It also wanted me to create an 8 hour work day divided into each hour, and next to each hour row was a textbox for the user to input a to do item.  Next to that is a save button, which is to create a local save for the list to maintain itself locally if the page was refreshed.

Here is the link:  

The project really taught me how to use API to insert them into a webpage or application.  I like how the sheet looks and works.

Bugs:  I had trouble doing the local save with the save buttons, as can be seen in my JavaScript code.  I researched this a ton, so I will be asking my tutor to walk me through this next week in my appointment.
